# Lost Ranger

Inspired by:
- "Lost Miner" android game
- "It Lurks Below"

You're a ranger because you mostly/only have ranged weapons.
At the start, you can pick up & throw rocks.
Then you can make a sling.
Then you make a bow & arrows.
There will be hunting, and potentially self-defence from wild animals.
And mining too.
